## Portfolio Docs

This site turns the repo into a browsable documentation portal (search + sidebar).

### Start here

- **Quick start**: see `Quick Start` in the sidebar for “what to show” by role.
- **Repo map**: see `Directory Structure` for the full tree and intent.
- **Deep dives**: see `Areas` for Cloud Security, DevSecOps, Kubernetes Security, SIEM/SOC, and Compliance.

### Notes

- Most “area” pages include the corresponding repo README so the docs stay in sync.
- Example account IDs, IPs, and domains are intentionally sanitized.
